# RCI-Computer Networks and the Internet (Redes de Computadores e internet, in portuguese) project


The purpose of this project was to build a secure chat. To do this, the client chooses a name and a family name and connects to the server with his family name. When he wants to chat to somebody, the server will look for the other user IP address and will send it to the user who requested the chat. They will then connect directly using a process of mutual authentication.

Communication between client-server and between servers use UDP whilst communication during chats between clients use TCP.
